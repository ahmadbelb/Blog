This talk presented retrofitting measures for the storwater drainage system of the IIT Madras campus. The 650-acre campus' stormwater drainage network is more than 50 years old fails frequently during big storms. The talk focussed on presenting a 3-phase expansion plan to include-
1. New culverts at frequently-flooded areas with high traffic
2. Stormwater drainage basin to control overflow from the campus lake
3. Sustainable stormwater drainage elements such as swales, greenroofs, etc.
