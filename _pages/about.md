I am a PhD candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford University. 

I develop machine learning algorithms to measure forest health (how wet or dry the forests are) using remote sensing. I work in the <a href="https://koningslab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Remote Sensing Ecohydrology Group</a> with Prof. Alexandra Konings. Before I started my PhD, I pursued my masters in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University and bachelors in Civil Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. For a brief period between my bachelors and masters, I was a wireline field engineer at Schlumberger in Northeast India. 

My research interests include understanding forest hydraulic health dynamics towards charecterizing wildfire risk and drought impacts on vegetation. To do so, I work across several scales - from plot-scale measurements to landscape-scale estimations.  To know more about my research, check out my [publications](https://krishnakrao.github.io/publications/) or [talks](https://krishnakrao.github.io/talks/). 

My work involves developing data-driven approaches to understand the Earth system. While learning skills related to data science, I worked on several projects to gain hands-on experience. The [projects tab](https://krishnakrao.github.io/projects/) includes such side projects.

My hobbies include bicycle touring, and triathlons. I am passionate about them and devote my entire free time to them. You can read more about my hobbies and other educational material on the [blog section](https://krishnakrao.github.io/blog/).
