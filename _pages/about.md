I am a Ph.D. candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford University. 

I develop machine learning algorithms to measure forest health (how wet or dry the forests are) using remote sensing. I work in the <a href="https://koningslab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Remote Sensing Ecohydrology Group</a> with Prof. Alexandra Konings. I got my bachleors in Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and my masters in Environmental Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology at Stanford University. During my bachelors and masters, I worked on several  independent studies which convinced me about the endless possibilities of impact-based research. My quest to develop technologies to measure forest health using remote sensing and machine learning is derived from that conviction. 

For a brief period between my bachelors and masters, I was a Wireline field engineer at Schlumberger in Northeast India where I designed, executed and delivered reservoir characterization projects.

_What I spent my time on in the last 10 years._

### Research

My research interests include understanding forest hydraulic health dynamics towards charecterizing wildfire risk and drought impacts on vegetation. To do so, I work across several scales - from plot-scale measurements to landscape-scale estimations.  To know more about my research, check out my [publications](https://krishnakrao.github.io/publications/) or [talks](https://krishnakrao.github.io/talks/). 

### Skills

My research work involves developing data-driven approaches to understand the Earth system. While learning skills related to data science, I worked on several projects to gain hands-on experience. The [projects tab](https://krishnakrao.github.io/projects/) includes such side projects.

### Hobbies

My hobbies include bicycle touring, and triathlons. I am passionate about them and devote my entire free time to them. You can read more about my hobbies and other educational material on the [blog section](https://krishnakrao.github.io/blog/).
