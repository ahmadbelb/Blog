_My path since 2014._

<!-- I am looking for an internship for the summer of 2021. I am eager to apply my skills in developing data-driven geospatial models to solve your problems! 

My skills include- 

1. Developing physics-guided deep learning models (marrying mechanistic principles with empirical methods)
2. Geospatial analytics
3. Hypothesis testing (including causal inference) 

I am open to work remotely from Stanford, CA. Interested or know anyone who might be interested in hiring me? [Please email me.](mailto:kkrao@stanford.edu) -->

I am a double master student at the Technical University of Munich.There I study Civil Engineering and Computational Science and Engineering

I develop physics-assisted machine learning algorithms to quantify bridges health (how safe or damaged the bridges are) using remote sensing. I work in the <a href="https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/cbm/chair-of-non-destructive-testing-ndt/" target="_blank">Chair of Non-destructive Testing</a> with Dr Alexander Mendler. I got my bachelors in Civil Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. During my bachelors and masters, I worked on several independent studies which convinced me about the endless possibilities of impact-based research. My quest to develop technologies to understand climate dynamics and help quantify climate change impacts on ecosystems is derived from that conviction.

### Computational Science and Engineering Research
 
 My research interests include understanding climate dynamics towards characterizing wildfire risk and drought impacts on the overall climate. For this purpose, I started my Computational Science and Engineering degree - where the need for high performance computing is required. To know more about my research, check out my [publications](https://ahmadbelb.github.io/Blog/publications/) or [talks](https://ahmadbelb.github.io/Blog/talks/). 
 
 
### Civil Engineering Research

My research interests include understanding structural health dynamics towards characterizing natural frequency and dynamic loads on bridges. To do so, I work across several scales - from Ansys simulations to data-driven damage features extraction. To know more about my research, check out my [publications](https://ahmadbelb.github.io/Blog/publications/) or [talks](https://ahmadbelb.github.io/Blog/talks/). 

### Skills

Since my research involves developing data-driven approaches, I apply machine learning and high-performance computing where required. While learning skills related to parallel computing in my coursework, I worked on several projects to gain hands-on experience. The [projects tab](https://ahmadbelb.github.io/Blog/projects/) includes such side projects.



### Job

For about 1 year now, I am a working student in Munich at TE connectivity. There, I designed, executed and delivered several projects for IoT integration (calibrating machines based on several parameters ) and features extraction (e.g., automating the machine start-up based on previous year data, etc.)

### Hobbies

My hobbies include hiking, and electric circuit design. I am passionate about them and devote my entire free time to them. You can read more about my hobbies on the [blog section](https://ahmadbelb.github.io/Blog/blog/).
